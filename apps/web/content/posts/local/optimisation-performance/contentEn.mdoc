Web performance has become a crucial factor for website success. Google takes it into account in its ranking algorithm.

## Core Web Vitals

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)

LCP measures the loading time of the largest visible element. To optimize it:

- Optimize your images (WebP format, lazy loading)
- Use a CDN
- Preload critical resources

### FID (First Input Delay)

FID measures your page's responsiveness. Improve it with:

- Code splitting
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Use Web Workers

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)

CLS measures visual stability. Reduce it by:

- Setting dimensions for images
- Reserving space for ads
- Avoiding dynamic content insertions
