Microservices architecture has become very popular, but it's not suitable for all projects. Let's see when to adopt it.

## What is a Microservice?

A microservice is an autonomous service that:

- Has a single responsibility
- Can be deployed independently
- Communicates via APIs
- Has its own database

## Advantages

### Targeted Scalability

You can scale only the services that need it, thus optimizing costs.

### Resilience

The failure of one service doesn't necessarily affect the others.

### Technological Flexibility

Each service can use the stack best suited to its use case.

## Disadvantages

### Operational Complexity

- Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Observability (logs, traces, metrics)
- Inter-service communication

### Data Consistency

Distributed transactions are complex to manage.

## When to Choose Microservices?

- Multiple autonomous teams
- Differentiated scalability needs
- Significant business complexity
