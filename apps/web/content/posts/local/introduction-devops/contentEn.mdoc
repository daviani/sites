DevOps is much more than just a set of tools or practices. It's a culture aimed at improving collaboration between development and operations teams.

## The Pillars of DevOps

### 1. Automation

Automation is at the heart of DevOps. It reduces human errors and speeds up deployment processes.

Collaboration between Dev and Ops teams is essential. Organizational silos must be broken down to foster fluid communication.

### 3. Continuous Measurement

Metrics are essential to understand the performance of your systems and identify areas for improvement.
