Web security is a crucial topic that every developer must master. Here are the main vulnerabilities to know about and how to protect against them.

## OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

XSS attacks allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a web page. To protect yourself:

- Always escape user data
- Use Content Security Policies (CSP)
- Validate inputs server-side

### SQL Injection

SQL injections exploit poorly constructed queries. Protect yourself with:

- Prepared statements
- A well-configured ORM
- Strict input validation

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

This attack forces an authenticated user to perform unwanted actions. Use CSRF tokens to protect yourself.
